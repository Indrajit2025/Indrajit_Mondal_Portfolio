> *"Student by day, Dev by night. 🐍 Python | ML | Backend."*

Welcome to my digital workspace. This repository hosts my personal portfolio website, a showcase of my journey as a **Data Science Enthusiast**, **Backend Specialist**, and **Hackathon Winner**. The site is engineered to be an immersive experience, blending modern web technologies with a sci-fi/cyberpunk aesthetic.

## 🚀 Features & Aesthetics

This isn't just a static HTML page. It's an interactive experience built with:

* **🌊 Cinematic Intro**: A custom 2D underwater overlay with animated kelp, fish schools, and rising bubbles.
* **🌌 The Cyber Sea (Three.js)**: A background 3D particle system representing a digital ocean that reacts to mouse movement.
* **🖱️ Sci-Fi HUD Cursor**: A custom JavaScript-driven cursor with a scanning animation and hover effects.
* **📜 Horizontal "Journey" Scroll**: Powered by **GSAP ScrollTrigger**, transforming vertical scroll into a horizontal timeline of my legacy.
* **🔮 Holo-Card Tilt Effects**: 3D tilt interactions on project and certificate cards for a tactile feel.
* **🌗 Dynamic Theme Switcher**: seamless toggle between **Neon Dark Mode** (Cyberpunk) and **Light Mode** (Clean Blue).
* **🚄 Smooth Scrolling**: Integrated **Lenis** for buttery smooth scroll mechanics.
